Visualization, timing and plots:

We know that the time complexity of fitting a decision tree onto a dataset has the time complexity: O(M*N*log(N))
Also, the time complexity for prediction would be O(log(depth)) 

So,  with const M, the expected trend would be Nlog(N)
and with const N, the expected tredn would be linear

We can see linear dependence of fit time with M and nlogn which is a rises faster than just O(n) (linear) can also be seen
